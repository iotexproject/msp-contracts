## MSP Contracts

Modular Security Pool for DePIN projects.

The Modular Security Pool (MSP) is a module that acts as a pool gathering staking security from various established Layer 1 blockchains and distributing that security to new networks, including DePINs and DePIN Infrastructure Providers (DIMs). This allows new networks to inherit the security of the underlying Layer 1 blockchains without having to build their own security infrastructure from scratch.
